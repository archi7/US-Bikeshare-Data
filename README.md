# US-Bikeshare-Data
This project is the part of Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree program
# Overview
In this project, i used Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics.
